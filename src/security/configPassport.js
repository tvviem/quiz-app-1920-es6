/**
 * Notice that these middlewares are initialized after the `express-session` middleware.  This is because
 * Passport relies on the `express-session` middleware and must have access to the `req.session` object.
 * 
 * passport.initialize() - This creates middleware that runs before every HTTP request.  It works in two steps: 
 *      1. Checks to see if the current session has a `req.session.passport` object on it.  This object will be
 *          
 *          { user: '<Mongo DB user ID>' }
 * 
 *      2.  If it finds a session with a `req.session.passport` property, it grabs the User ID and saves it to an 
 *          internal Passport method for later.
 *  
 * passport.session() - This calls the Passport Authenticator using the "Session Strategy".  Here are the basic
 * steps that this method takes:
 *      1.  Takes the MongoDB user ID obtained from the `passport.initialize()` method (run directly before) and passes
 *          it to the `passport.deserializeUser()` function (defined above in this module).  The `passport.deserializeUser()`
 *          function will look up the User by the given ID in the database and return it.
 *      2.  If the `passport.deserializeUser()` returns a user object, this user object is assigned to the `req.user` property
 *          and can be accessed within the route.  If no user is returned, nothing happens and `next()` is called.
